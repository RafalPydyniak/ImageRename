# Image Rename
#### What does this project do
This project contains only one class (beside test one and main) which currently has only one public method and one functionality. This method basically renames all images in given directory basing on date when image was taken so for example image "Canon-222.jpg" could be renamed to "20160510093956.jpg"

#### Why?
Just for my own use. I had a lot of pictures taken from different devices and their names were all different like "Canon-321.jpg", "2016-05-01-01-01.jpg" and "LG-23232". I just wanted to have them all in one naminga convention.

Also this simple project was a great opportunity to create project in tdd from beggining to end. I've been using tdd for some time now but mostly I used it only for some parts of creating application - now I could do it all the time! ;)
